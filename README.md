# 🐍 Retro Snake

A classic Snake game built in C++ using [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/), featuring smooth gameplay, sound effects, score tracking, and a retro aesthetic.

Retro Snake is a modern take on the timeless arcade classic. The snake lives on a 25×25 grid, growing one segment longer every time it devours a piece of food. The challenge ramps up naturally — the longer your snake, the harder it becomes to avoid your own tail. One wrong turn and it's game over.

## 🎨 Customization

You can tweak these constants at the top of `main.cpp`:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `cellsize` | `30` | Size of each grid cell in pixels |
| `cellCount` | `25` | Number of cells per row/column |
| `offset` | `75` | Border width in pixels |

The game window size is calculated automatically as `2 * offset + cellsize * cellCount`.

## 🧠 How It Works

The game is structured around three core classes:

- **`Snake`** — Stores the snake's body as a `deque<Vector2>`, where the front is the head and the back is the tail. Movement is handled by pushing a new head cell and popping the tail each tick. Eating food skips the pop, effectively growing the snake by one.

- **`Food`** — Loads a custom texture and picks a random grid cell that does not overlap the snake's body. A new position is generated every time the snake eats.

- **`Game`** — Orchestrates everything: it owns the snake and food, runs collision detection on every update tick, tracks the score and best score, and manages the running/stopped state.

The main loop runs at 60 FPS, but snake movement is decoupled from the frame rate — the snake updates every 200 ms using a time-based trigger, giving it that characteristic step-by-step arcade feel.
